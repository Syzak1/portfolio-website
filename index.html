        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>As a current college student, I eagerly bring my passion to all my projects. 
            I have worked on multiple projects that showcase my ability to develop unique ideas and creative mechanics.
            I have experience with c# and the Unity engine, but I can also tackle tasks such as music composition, sound design, art, and story.
            I find enjoyment when integrating my ideas clearly into my projects, as a gamer myself I heavily take inspiration from the games I enjoy.
            Strong story telling and engaging gamelay is my cup of tea.</p>
