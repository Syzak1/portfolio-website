    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <pre>
	Going into this project, I really didn’t think I would be able to interact and work coherently with others in a course I never had experience with. But even after the individual assignment, I was very surprised by my experience in working with them when it came to fixing bugs and issues with the unity animations and interaction. After the first two weeks of working together, I got much more involved and took advantage of having others to cover for certain parts. Adding a lot of personal additions to the game added much more personality to the game than it would’ve had without it. It really just came down to how many reasonable additions can I make to this game without disrupting the workflow of my teammates. I eventually started to research music references of a similar genre, medieval. But since the weaponry was mainly modern, I also had to incorporate sound effects to insinuate the weapons in use. After a while I found Castle Crashers and the Star Wars soundtrack were good reference materials to base my music development on. This eventually led to my intro animation design being based off castle crashers and my main gameplay music design being based off a march from John Williams.

    <h2>Role</h2>
    <pre>
My targeted role in this group was music development, sound design, and art. I developed the game’s weapon art & animation,  image detection, weapon swapping, intro animation, sound effects, and music. On top of this, I also helped implement the enemy animations into their movement code. Starting off the first two weeks, I developed the first gun model based on the older styles of Doom weapons. And over the Thanksgiving break I developed the intro animation with music included. One of the first properties I made was image detection, this process went pretty fast by following the provided tutorial from our previous AR assignment. Most of this mechanic is mainly managed by its already included Tracked Image Manager and Library. All I needed to do was attach a GIMM Cohort banner to its library, allowing us to display our unlock prefab, which allows for the player to unlock a new weapon. After a few mishaps and changes with the player bullet detection, we got the unlock code working, allowing for both the new weapon to be unlocked and the ability to swap between the weapons to be allowed. 
After we cleared that debacle, I then went on the create the background music for the gameplay. The music itself is 2:31 in length and loops to make sure there is no awkward downtime. I based the music on a medieval type of march, heavily inspired by John Williams, with March from Star Wars. Along with this, I included some of my own written parts, mainly appearing in the second half of the song. 

I put a lot of effort into the music of this game, so I wanted the gameplay to have the same effort. When implementing the enemy animations, I wanted the enemies to act frantically alive. With the combined movement code from Patrick and animations from Gavin, I gave a lot of personality to the enemies. By setting and resetting triggered animations, I gave the enemies delays in their turns & movements. I also implemented their shooting animation every time they would spawn a bullet, giving them much more livelyness since the gap between shots is short. I did the same for our other enemies of different classes too, just in case. After, I added a few touchups on everything else, adding sound effects, an app icon, delayed deaths for the enemies, and updating the music every now & then. This gave a lot of personality to the game as a whole, giving a lot of responsiveness through action and sound design.
