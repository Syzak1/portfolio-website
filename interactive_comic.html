    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <pre>
	After my experience with the individual project and the AR project in GIMM 150, I had an immense amount of experience with adobe photoshop and animate, so for this project that was my main role. Going into GIMM 250 I wasn’t specifically expecting to be placed with one of the given options mentioned in GIMM 150, that being Quantum Entanglement. When I grouped up with the same people from GIMM 150 for this project and our assigned subject was quantum entanglement, I really didn’t know where to start. After some research we found and summed up quantum entanglement within 3 characteristics, the property of needed observation for superposition, the property of the entanglement between two particles, and what the genius Einstein describes as,”spooky action at a distance”. These are the cornerstones of which we built a comic upon, describing an entangled particle itself as a singular form of matter, which is in a state of superposition, being within a state of a “coin-flip”, either displaying one thing or another. This superposition must be observed to understand its state, such as how electrons are constantly in a state of superposition until measured. For quantum entanglement, this superposition applies to particles at once within the same instance as, their entangled information shifts collectively, because rather than the information harboring in one piece of matter, it is shared between the two. Finally, this entanglement between the two particles works within an infinite amount of range, showcasing that quantum entanglement affects both particles in a way that ignores speed, overcoming the speed of light at any distance. These are the matters in which we worked to formulate our understanding and story of quantum entanglement.

    <h2>Role</h2>
    <pre>
Now as much as I would “love” to mess around with those mechanics and integrate them within the game, that role was already covered, so I planned to play set-up and forge the story and build up into it. At first our comic was planned to be an infographic and seeing how none of us within the team knew what we were doing that seemed like the best option. After our first meeting though, it seemed like we needed to rework it, so the team forged checkpoints to where our story would pan out. Summing it up, Reid started the story out with a spaceship going through a wormhole and crashing, Gavin added the idea of a cave that provided unusual quantum mechanics to describe entanglement, finally Patrick was planning to integrate a galaxy & solar system interaction that displayed the characteristics of entanglement. I then set my job to somehow connect these checkpoints together to a coherent story that led up to 20-24 panels of art or other. For galaxy inspiration, I used a reference from the art of the Terraria Catalyst Mod, which hosted a plethora of vibrant purple colors. From there on, that set the tone and style for the rest of my art. I continued to color in this style, making the astronaut silver, the plantation & terrain maroon, and the rocks dark gray. By doing this I hoped to build a vibrant and yet eerie scene for the player to traverse. I used this same art for the animations I produced for our comic, totaling to 13 panels of art, 1 gif, and 6 animations. The majority of these animations took advantage of the use of Adobe's tween options, which allowed for consistent movement between frames and effective time management. Back to the art, I made use of the burn tool to add shading, lens flare tool to give certain textures a relative characteristic, and used overlapping pictures to give texture, learned this from a friend that took web development.

     <h2>Additional</h2>

But even so I didn’t feel like I should have free time after completing all those panels so I decided to get creative and add other characteristics that could add to this eerie, space theme. I then searched for some sound effects that gave some sort of eerie space ambience, unlike the other games I worked on, this project has a lack of actual music and leans into a more uneasy feel. Because of course the best way to amplify the unknown is by adding tension and emptiness. To add on to this idea of sci-fi, I incorporated some dialogue that was voice acted by a friend of mine that I know has the most dead sounding monotone voice ever. So with that, he played as the role of the AI assistant that tagged along with the player, this reduced the effort everyone needed to make to effectively explain quantum entanglement, it also gave more intel on the story to the player. To add-on, his voice was also very digitized by his microphone when recording for some reason, so that furthered our chances of characterizing the AI dialogue. After I collected sound effects, voice acting, and art, I then was the first to start piecing together all of these properties in a unity build. I based the order of each scene by the order I made in our discord. With the help of Reid, we gave the animations transitions if they were back to back, and I implemented the sound effects & dialogue with their respective panels. After a lot of touching up, each scene had a transition and was given sound. Even so, after all that I felt it was missing something, so yesterday, that being the day before this document’s dated time, I made a dialogue script. After fiddling around and merging many inspiring scripts I aligned the captions to activate per line spoken by the AI dialogue.
